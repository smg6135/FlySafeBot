# flysafe_bot

Made with [BootBot CLI](https://github.com/Charca/bootbot-cli)

Bot that helps you to fly safe abroad.

## Usage

install all the dependencies listed
```
    "bootbot: "^1.0.6",
    "cheerio": "^1.0.0-rc.10",
    "config": "^1.21.0",
    "newsapi": "^2.4.1",
    "request": "^2.88.2"
```

Since, this is a facebook bot, it needs to have a ACCESS_TOKEN and APP_SECRET code to run.
These can be obtained through Facebook's [Quick Start Guide](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/guides/quick-start)

After setting up the config, start the bot with
```
bootbot start
```

After, bootbot will inform you with webhook URL and VERIFY_TOKEN, which can be used to initiate the webhook for the bot.
